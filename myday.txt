A few sentences about the start of my day:

I woke up after a refreshing sleep and ate a nice breakfast.
Then I opened my computer and began continuing to configure my
setup when I decided to try using Vim for everything since I've
read that it is a powerful tool for editing text. I was confused
at first when I started using it, so I signed up for this course
on Udemy called "Vim Masterclass" taught by James Cannon in order
to sharpen my skills. So here I am!

3 things that I am grateful for:
1) Family and friends
2) Food and good health
3) Technology and computers
